<h1>Attending classes</h1>

<p class="pforattending">This was my first day in another school, I feel strange but novel. I enjoy making friends with a classmate and this time I helped and respected them sincerely compare to the previous environment. I open my heart step by step because I discover that my friends are all kind and willing to help me get out of the depression, they listen to my story and comfort me in a way that they think is not painful, I understand what the friends mean to me. Since I transfer to another school, my smile appears more than usual. Thank you, my friends!
