<h1>Environmental changes</h1>

<p class="p-for-secondpage">When I first knew that my parents applied the middle school, I felt a little excited, I was dreaming how many friends I could make and having an extreme nervousness about how do they look at me, can I join their group, could I be the friend with them? But the reality gives me a big punch, I was being placed in a class with none of them wanting to be a friend with me, it seems like they keep me out of their group. At the age of 13, I didn't know what is the meaning of bullying and discrimination, I expected they will accept me and make friends with me; this is what the Chinese tend to think, they will wait until you speak out, if you didn't express yourself, they will hide at wait for your response forever.</p>
