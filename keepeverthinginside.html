<h1>Suffering staking up every day  </h1>

<p class="p-for-secondpage">In this situation, every day to me was suffering. I decided to close my heart and just want to pretend that I do not exist in the school, because I don't trust anybody in the school. Exteriorly, I listened to the teacher and helped my classmate, but in my deep mind, I hated it, I felt like this wasn't me. The turning point comes from when my parents decided to move to another place, they have to file the transfer documents, therefore, to me, it was a piece of very good news.  </p>
